# mpstk - the MultiParty Session Types toolKit

mpstk is a toolkit for **specifying multiparty protocols** and
**verifying their properties** (e.g., deadlock-freedom and liveness).

mpstk is based on the **generalised theory of multiparty session
types** presented in the companion paper:

*  Alceste Scalas and Nobuko Yoshida.
   [Less is More: Multiparty Session Types Revisited](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290343).
